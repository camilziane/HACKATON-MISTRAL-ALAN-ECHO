This summer, my family and I embarked on a memorable trip filled with adventure and relaxation. We visited the charming coastal town of Nice, where we spent our days strolling along the Promenade des Anglais, basking in the sun on its beautiful beaches, and enjoying delicious Mediterranean cuisine. We explored nearby villages like Eze and Villefranche-sur-Mer, where the cobblestone streets and stunning views left us in awe. Evenings were spent together savoring local dishes and sharing laughter, making this a family vacation weâ€™ll cherish for years.
