    "description": "Jane will never forget the afternoons Jane spent with Grandpa. When Jane was little, Grandpa would always hold Jane on Grandpa's lap and show Jane how to write with Grandpa's favorite green pen. Grandpa would tell Jane stories about Grandpa's childhood while patiently guiding Jane's tiny hand, helping Jane form letters. Jane didn't understand much back then, but Jane loved the sound of Grandpa's voice and the warmth of Grandpa's embrace. Even though it was something as simple as writing, it felt like the most important thing in the world because Jane and Grandpa were doing it together."
