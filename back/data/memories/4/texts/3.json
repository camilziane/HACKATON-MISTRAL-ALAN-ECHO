When I was little, he would always hold me on his lap and show me how to write with his favorite green pen. He\u2019d tell me stories about his childhood while patiently guiding my tiny hand, helping me form letters. I didn't understand much back then, but I loved the sound of his voice and the warmth of his embrace. Even though it was something as simple as writing, it felt like the most important thing in the world because we were doing it together."}
