    "description": "When David was little, Grandpa Robert used to take David out to the garden. Grandpa Robert always had Grandpa Robert's pipe in hand, and David remembers Grandpa Robert smiling at David the way Grandpa Robert did in that old photoâ€”the one where Grandpa Robert is holding David, a tiny bundle wrapped in blue. Grandpa Robert was so proud, even though David had no idea what was happening at the time. David always loved hearing Grandpa Robert's stories as David got older, about how that greenhouse behind them was where Grandpa Robert grew the best tomatoes, how every plant had a story, just like David and Grandpa Robert."
