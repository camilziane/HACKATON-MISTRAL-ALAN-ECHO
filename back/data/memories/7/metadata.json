    "description": "When I was little, Grandpa Robert used to take me out to the garden. He always had his pipe in hand, and I remember him smiling at me the way he did in that old photo\u2014the one where he's holding me, a tiny bundle wrapped in blue. He was so proud, even though I had no idea what was happening at the time. I always loved hearing his stories as I got older, about how that greenhouse behind us was where he grew the best tomatoes, how every plant had a story, just like us."
